i have been developing this code in unbuntu as i could not figure out how to link
the jpeg library in devc++ or any other platform

i have the jpeg library installed on my unbuntu virtual machine
the compilation code is the following:
gcc -g -o lineIso lineIso.c -ljpeg

note: the -g allows for gdb debugging, and the -ljpeg linkes the jpeg library

run the code with the following:
./lineIso

function of the code:
the code uses a threshold of 50 to isolate the red line from all other colors
any pixel which does not match this treshold is set to black removing all unneccessary pixels
the input image may be of any size but must be in jpeg format named "input.jpg"
the output image is named "output.jpg"

chatgpt was used in the making of this code.
